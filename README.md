# Concept2 Logbook Scraper

Scrapes the Concept2 Logbook site (log.concept2.com) and saves the information in JSON format. Uses multi-threading to spead up the scraping process (~ linear with the number of threads but please be kind to the server!)

Currently only captures information from the rankings (https://log.concept2.com/rankings).
